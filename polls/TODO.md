- [ ] avoiding race conditions using [F()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/expressions/#avoiding-race-conditions-using-f)
- [ ] testing. Questions can be published on the site that have no Choices. So, our views could check for this, and exclude such Questions
- [ ] testing. Add [selenium](https://selenium.dev/) and some basic in-browser test. [LiveServerTestCase](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.LiveServerTestCase) is our Django test class for this.
